# Cloud Concepts

##  What is cloud computing?
* Delivery of computing services over the internet, enabling faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.
 ---
## Cloud Models:
* Public Cloud:
    * Owned by cloud services or hosting provider.
    * Provides resources and services to multiple organizations and users.
    * Accessed via secure network connection (typically over the internet).
    ---
* Private Cloud:
    * Organizations create a cloud environment in their datacenter.
    * Organization is responsible for operating the services they provide.
    * Does not provide access to users outside of the organization.
    ---
* Hybrid Cloud:
    * Combines Public and Private clouds to allow applications to run in the most appropriate location.
    ---
* Cloud Models At A Glance:

    | Public Cloud | Private Cloud | Hybrid Cloud |
    |:---------------:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
    | No capital expenditures to scale up. | Hardware must be purchased for start-up and maintenance. | Provides the most flexibility.  |
    | Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned. | Organizations have complete control over resources and security. | Organizations determine where to run their applications. |
    | Organizations pay only for what they use. | Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates. | Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements. |

## Cloud Benefits & Considerations:
* Benefits:

    * *Agility* is the ability to rapidly develop, test and launch software applications.
    * *Elasticity* is the ability to quickly increase or decrease computing power and resources.
    * *Fault Tolerance* is the ability of a system to continue operating despite failures or malfunctions.
    * *High availability* is a quality of computing infrastructure that allows it to continue functioning, even when some of its components fail.
    * *Predictive cost considerations* as cloud uses consumption-based pricing model.
    * *Reliability* is the possibility to recover from failures at any scale and ensure that workloads of your cloud apps are available.
    * *Scalability* refers to scaling out or scaling up cloud resources.

* Considerations:

    * Capital Expediture (CapEx):
        * Money spent by a business or organization on acquiring or maintaining fixed assets, such as land, buildings, and equipment.
        * Large upfront investments.
    * Operational Expediture (OpEx):
        * An ongoing cost for running a product, business, or system on a day-to-day basis, including annual costs.
    * Consumption-based Pricing Model (PAYG):
        * End users only pay for the resources that they use.
        * Better cost prediction.

## Cloud Services:
* Infrastructure As A Service (IaaS):
    * Build pay-as-you-go IT infrastructure by renting servers, virtual machines, storage, networks, and operating systems from a cloud provider.
  ---
* Platform As A Service (PaaS):
    * Provides environment for building, testing, and deploying software applications; without focusing on managing underlying infrastructure.
  ---
* Software As A Service (SaaS):
    * Users connect to and use cloud-based apps over the internet.
  ---

* Cloud Services At A Glance:

    | IaaS | PaaS | SaaS |
    |:---------------:|:---------------:|:--------------:|
    | The most flexible cloud service. | Focus on application development. | Pay-as-you-go pricing model. |
    | You configure and manage the hardware for your application. | Platform management is handled by the cloud provider. | Users pay for the software they use on a subscription model. |
  ---
* Serverless Computing:
    * Customers donâ€™t have any servers.
    * The serverless cloud service provider automatically provisions, scales, and manages the infrastructure required to run the code.
  ---

*  [Shared Responsibility Model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/shared-responsibility):
    * Cloud security is a shared responsibility of both cloud providers and customers.
    * Cloud provider is responsible for **_Securing the Cloud_**.
    * Cloud custome is responsible for **_Securing what's in the Cloud_**.
